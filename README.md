# Cast Latest Video

  

This quick and dirty python script will cast the latest video of a YouTuber's uploads to your specified chromecast/google home device

  

It checks every hour for new uploads and if it finds one, it will play it.

  

You need to get an API key, you can read how to that [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/python) 

Requirements can be installed using ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

Requires Python 3.
